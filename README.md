# Million dev setup

> Note: I'm not sure how to correctly setup a dev environment for Next.js â€“ this is a key piece needed to solve hydration

## Getting started

1. Clone + `pnpm install`
2. Replace the absolute paths in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` with yours
3. `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server
4. View the site at `localhost:5173/__inspect` to view code diffs
5. Also feel free to live test in `/test`
